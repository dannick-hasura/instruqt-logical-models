# Hasura Logical Models - Instruqt

This project is a monorepo that contains two main folders:

1. `hasura`: This folder contains the Hasura configuration and code. It includes the schema definition, custom business logic, and event triggers for the Hasura GraphQL engine.

2. `instruqt`: This folder contains the Instruqt configuration files. It includes the setup, solve, check, and cleanup scripts as well as the content markdown for each challenge. Using the instruqt CLI we can push changes in this folder e.g. `instruqt push track`
